    <h1>About Crystal</h1>
    <p> I'm a sophomore at SITHS. I don't feel very connected to my generation--I am almost always out of date with
        slang along with other differences.
        I think I'm pretty good at school. Am I a nerd? Yeah, probably.
    </p>
    <h2> Unusual things about me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I am somewhat paranoid. For example, if someone rings at my door, I immediately assume they're a serial
            killer and thus plan out my escape routes.
        </li>
        <li>
            I read a lot, but not books. I read fanfiction, primarily on <a href='archiveofourown.org'
                alt='fanfiction website link'>Archive of Our Own</a> (otherwise known as ao3).
        </li>
        <li>
            I actively try to avoid most social media platforms like Tiktok because I do <span
                style="font-style: italic;">not</span> want to get addicted.
        </li>
    </ul>
